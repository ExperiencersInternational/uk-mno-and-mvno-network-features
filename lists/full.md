# Full list of features that certain UK mobile networks support

Depending on the provider, certain plans may be in a separate category (e.g. like O2 Pay Monthly and O2 Pay as You Go)

This is by no means a full list at the moment and is largely experimental. Some information may be taken from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126in1zdWmjTkPB1dU2OvWF7BzTpNWiJLPGWgZ3C0n-Q/edit?usp=sharing), by [this user](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/talk/members/bubblesthefish6.33345/).
